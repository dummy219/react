for the week-container
i wanted the days (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday) to scroll but only show the current yesterday, today, and tomorrow with the today being the magnified/ have larger font compared to the rest. it sounds a little ambitious but if i cannot figure it out then i'll simplify it. something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODRCOclu6E4 but the yester and tomorrow is still visible.
